## Features

| Feature              | Description                                           | Release Planned | Release Actual | Deviations                 | Who/Percentage Worked on                |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Search Page          | Implementation of a search page with API integration for fetching recipes based on nationality and name | Alpha           | Alpha          | On the search results screen we planned to display: the recipe image, name, description and cook time; however, the screen is only able to display the recipe image and name. This reduction is because the recipe description and cook time are not retrievable through the API call.  | Summer 75% Faiza 25%  |

| Settings View Controller | Allows users to edit their allergens and dietary restrictions, and log out functionality | Beta            | Beta           | In our original design, we had both a profile page and a settings page. However, based on the feedback from our Design, we realized that the profile and "social media" aspect wasn't in the scope or focus of our app. Therefore, we decided to combine and simplify this into just the settings page. | Annie 80%   Trent 20% |
